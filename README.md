- Why was the project undertaken? 
- What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?

We chose the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset for our final project because we are all interested in satisfying flight experiences and believe that it is important for airlines to take their passenger's reviews into consideration.

With this dataset, we are going to predict what factors may be most relevant and most correlated to the passenger's satisfaction. We will be analyzing which features are most correlated to our topic and dropping those that aren't as relevant/needed.

We plan to use the "satisfaction" feature as our target label for this project.
The features that we plan to use as predictors for our project are: Seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, cleanliness, and food & drinks.
